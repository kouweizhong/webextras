The CSS and Scripts required for the jQuery dataTables, jqPlot, jQuery Flot library bindings to display properly are included in the 'extras' folder.

This is done so that they don't automatically get included in your project when you install the package in case you are only looking to use the extension methods.

You may wish to add them manually.
