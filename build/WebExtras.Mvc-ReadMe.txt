The Views folders which contains a partial view to render the jQuery dataTable using the provided binding is included in the 'extras' folder.

This is done so that they don't automatically get included in your project when you install the package in case you are only looking to use the extension methods.

You may wish to add them manually.

Version Specific Notes:
-----------------------

2.1.0.15: 
As of this version extension methods that depend on the T4MVC templating engine have been moved to a different NuGet package called "WebExtras.Mvc.T4". 
This is so as to account for the fact that not all .NET MVC project may use the T4MVC templating engine which would lead to runtime errors if they
use these extension methods.
